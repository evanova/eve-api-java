        of Electronic Counter Measures (ECM) modules. The holder has learned ECM is
        a chance-based tool that, when successful, prevents the target from holding
        target locks. This is a good skillset for capsuleers specializing in small,
        medium or large Caldari Disruption vessels based on Frigate, Cruiser and Battleship
        hulls.
